# ampappa3_finalexam

CodeReview:
This code is incorrect. Sub should be the appended value that keeps a total, and is returned at the end. First can keep an index. The goal is to return a value that is a total, so we want to store it in a variable then return that variable.

Edited program to properly reflect description of assignment.
